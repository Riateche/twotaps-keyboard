Twotaps is on-screen keyboard created for fast typing. After some training you will be able to type text very fast. Every symbol can be typed by pressing two buttons. Firstly press the button containing wanted symbol, then press another one (appropriate captions will appear on all buttons). If you want to type capitalized letter press shift before. Use backspace key to cancel input.

In Twotaps you don't need to change layout, switch to symbols or numeric modes. All symbols are equally easy to type. Every symbol is placed exactly on its position and never moved. Capitalization doesn't switch itself (after typing period symbol for example). Keyboard behave very predictable. After you remember symbols layout, you even don't need to look at buttons while typing. As long as Twotaps consists in only 15 buttons, they are rather big. You can tap wanted button easily without aiming. This also promotes fast typing.

In bottom right corner there is settings button that provides ability to use Caps Lock and switch to numeric mode (it's also enabled automatically while editing numeric fields). You can type many repeated symbols by holding a button.

Now Twotaps has only one layout that contains latin and russian letters. In the future, layouts for other countries will appear. Please email to me if you have suggestions about keyboard layouts.
